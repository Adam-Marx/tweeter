# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project honed my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express back-end skills.

## Final Product

Tweeter makes use of many features, and most of the work went into manipulating the HTML displayed on the web page with CSS and javascript, linking style sheets and scripts to the HTML head tag to do so.
