# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project honed my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and my Node, Express back-end skills.

## Final Product

Tweeter makes use of many features, and most of the work went into manipulating the HTML displayed on the web page with CSS and JavaScript, linking style sheets and scripts to the HTML head tag to do so.

This is the default view of Tweeter on desktop. It makes use of the larger horizontal space by displaying the profile on the left and the tweet history on the right.

One of Tweeters most important design choices was to use Responsive Web Design to adjust the way it presents the HTML depending on the size of the screen of the user.

Tweeter has a host of other small nifty features, such as error messages encouraging the user to interact properly, and buttons to slide the tweet form up or down.
